# command

A clone of OSX's spotlight feature. I wanted to make an attractive way to start processes and programs that I run constantly.
command uses the GitHub's electron project to create the UI and node.js to interface with the os. 

## Getting Started

You can use Node.js' npm to run the application from source.

```shell
npm install
npm start
```
